  <h3><span>Seismica</span> is an awesome app that lets you see seismic data from IRIS web services
    (http://service.iris.edu)</h3>
  <h4>Just enter the dates and time and the magnitudes in the form and hit the 'start' button. You'll see earthquakes
    from that period
    displayed on the map. Now you can select an earthquake to view its seismic wave and other details.</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>To rotate the map, simply click and hold on the map while moving your mouse from left to right.</li>
    <li>If you're waiting too long for the data to load on the map, try submitting the form with different dates or
      magnitudes to narrow down the results. The seimic map may not load when there are too many earthquake data to
      present.</li>
    <li>You can also save earthquake data and waves for later, allowing you to compare different earthquakes.</li>
    <li>Please note that data may be incomplete, especially for older events where seismic details are not stored
      in the database.</li>
  </ul>
